# Woolworths NZ New Slots Notifier

During the Covid lockdowns, grocery delivery and pickup slots at Countdown (Woolworths NZ) were almost impossible to get. This little script watched for newly available delivery/pickup slots and alerted me as soon as one opened up, so I could grab it and get supplies for the family.

It’s a tiny project from a tough time, but it still makes a nice example of a practical, real-world automation script.

## Features

- ✅ Periodically checks available delivery / pickup slots for selected stores  
- ✅ Notifies you whenever a new slot appears  
- ✅ Simple configuration via environment variables  
- ✅ Lightweight script you can run on a laptop, Raspberry Pi, or a small server
